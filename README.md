## Personal Projects

### Custom Mechanical Keyboard (South Paw FRL 1800 - Spring 2022)

![SPFRL1800 Blue/White & Black/White](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SP1.jpg?raw=true)

![PCB KiCAD](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SPPCB3.png?raw=true)

![PCB](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SPPCB2.jpg?raw=true)

Designed a unique layout mechanical keyboard and wrist rest from scratch using KiCAD, OnShape, and laser cutting. See [SPFRL1800 Open-Source Repository](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/SPFRL1800) for more details (and instructions on how to make your own!).

### Custom Mechanical Keyboard (Split Ortho - Fall 2021)

![PCB](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/KBSplitOrtho.png?raw=true)

Designed a 3D printed split-ortholinear mechanical keyboard from scratch.

### Switch Opener (Fall 2021)

![Switch Opener](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SWOpener2.jpg?raw=true)

Designed and CNC machined mechanical keyboard switch opener using Solidworks, HSMWorks, and HURCO VM10i.

## Research
Research work that I have performed under a few different PIs throughout college.

### Terradynamics Lab at Johns Hopkins University (Summer 2021-Fall 2021)
![HICS Collage](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/JHUCollage.png?raw=true)

At the JHU Terradynamics Lab I developed 2 iterations of a multi-functional legged robots capable of traversing complex terrain. The robots featured S-Shaped legs, a rounded shell, actuated wings, and a 2 DOF tail. The robots were constructed out of laser cut acrylic and 3D printed PLA and TPU. Robot controls were written with Python to control Dynamixel Servo motors. I was the first author of the [paper submitted to the 2022 ICRA Conference](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/other/IRCA2022Paper.pdf)) and was selected as a finalist for the outstanding locomotion award.


### Video Processing Lab at UCSD (Summer 2020-Spring 2021)
![HICS Collage](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/HICSCollage.png?raw=true)

At the UCSD Video Processing Lab I developed 2 computer vision test benches (top left and bottom) as well as a 2D -> 3D Polar Lidar room mapping platform (top right). The test benches mimicked human eye motion to create a novel Human Inspired Camera System (HICS). I was a co-first author of the [paper submitted to the 2020 ISOCC Conference](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/other/HICSPaper.pdf).

### UCSD QI Calit2 Prototyping Lab (Summer 2019-Spring 2020)
![PL Collage](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/PLCollage.png?raw=true)

At the UCSD Prototyping Lab I worked with various research and student groups across campus to bring to life ideas. I utilized a wide range of skills including PCB soldering, SolidWorks CAD, CNC and manual machining, laser cutting, and FDM and SLA 3D printing. Some of the projects I worked on included a 5 DOF underwater UAV for oil pipeline inspection (hydraulic actuator top left), rat behavior maze (top right), 7 DOF biopsy robot (bottom left), and Giant Sloth Pelvis cradle (bottom right).

## Class Projects

### 8-Bit Kogge Stone Adder
![KSA](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/KSACollage.png?raw=true)

In my digital integrated circuit design course I designed a custom 8-Bit Kogge Stone Adder (top center) from the transistor level in Cadence using gpdk045 technology. The design utilized static CMOS logic and was the fastest adder in the class. Logic gates (XNOR shown bottom left) and PG logic (black cell shown bottom right) were sized to minimize delay from parasitic capacitances. [A detailed report can be viewed here](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/other/Final_Project_ECE165_SP22.pdf).

### Line Follower Car
![ECE5Car](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/ECE5Car.jpg?raw=true)

In my ECE project course I designed a line follower car with a 3D printed unibody chassis, Arduino controller, precise PID tuning, and five photoresistors for color sensing. The car I designed and programmed was the fastest line follower robot in the class.

## First Robotics Competition (FRC)

Design and build lead from 2017-2019 on FRC Team 3647. I led the team to grow from never having won an award to win three regional events, two finalist awards, and eight technical awards.

I led the development and design of all the below robots over a tight six week build season. All the robots that I have designed utilize ESCs with brushed and brushless motors, closed loop feedback control with encoders, and pneumatic actuators.


![FRC 2022](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FRC2022Collage.png?raw=true)

**2022 Robot:** I designed the drivetrain, serializer (right bottom), and climber mechanisms (right center).
<br/><br/>

![FRC 2020](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FRC2020Collage.png?raw=true)

**2020 Robot:** I designed the drivetrain, intake (right center), and shooter mechanisms (right bottom).
<br/><br/>

![FRC 2019](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FRC2019Collage.png?raw=true)

**2019 Robot:** I designed the entire robot including the drivetrain, elevator, intakes, and climber mechanisms. <br/><br/>

![FRC 2018](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FRC2018.jpeg?raw=true)

**2018 Robot:** I designed the drivetrain, climbing, and intaking mechanisms.
<br/><br/>

![FRC 2017](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FRC2017.jpg?raw=true)

**2017 Robot:** I designed the drivetrain and climbing mechanisms.


## Machining

Various machining projects from over the years on manual machines, HAAS CNC, HURCO CNC, and CNC Routers.

![FSAE](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FSAECollage.png?raw=true)

Above all were CAMed and cut on a HAAS VMC by myself for the UCSD FSAE team. 

![PL Machining Collage](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/PLMachiningCollage.png?raw=true)

Top two images show aluminum, urethane resin, and high density foam composite base plate for robot. Bottom two images show aluminum parts for custom hydraulic actuators for underwater robot. All parts were CAMed and CNC'd by myself on a CNC Router and Hurco VM10i respectively.
