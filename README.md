## Personal Projects

### Custom Mechanical Keyboard (South Paw FRL 1800 - Spring 2022)

![SPFRL1800 Blue/White & Black/White](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SP1.jpg?raw=true)

![PCB KiCAD](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SPPCB3.png?raw=true)

![PCB](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SPPCB2.jpg?raw=true)

Designed a unique layout mechanical keyboard and wrist rest from scratch using KiCAD, OnShape, and laser cutting. See [SPFRL1800 Open-Source Repository](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/SPFRL1800) for more details (and instructions on how to make your own!).

### Custom Mechanical Keyboard (Split Ortho - Fall 2021)

![PCB](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/KBSplitOrtho.png?raw=true)

Designed a 3D printed split-ortholinear mechanical keyboard from scratch.

### Switch Opener (Fall 2021)

![Switch Opener](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SWOpener2.jpg?raw=true)

Designed and CNC machined mechanical keyboard switch opener using Solidworks, HSMWorks, and HURCO VM10i.

## Research
Research work that I have performed under a few different PIs throughout college.

### Terradynamics Lab at Johns Hopkins University (Summer 2021-Fall 2021)
![HICS Collage](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/JHUCollage.png?raw=true)

At the JHU Terradynamics Lab I developed 2 iterations of a multi-functional legged robots capable of traversing complex terrain. The robots featured S-Shaped legs, a rounded shell, actuated wings, and a 2 DOF tail. The robots were constructed out of laser cut acrylic and 3D printed PLA and TPU. Robot controls were written with Python to control Dynamixel Servo motors. I was the first author of the [paper submitted to the 2022 ICRA Conference](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/other/IRCA2022Paper.pdf)) and was selected as a finalist for the outstanding locomotion award.


### Video Processing Lab at UCSD (Summer 2020-Spring 2021)
![HICS Collage](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/HICSCollage.png?raw=true)

At the UCSD Video Processing Lab I developed 2 computer vision test benches as well as a 2D -> 3D Polar Lidar room mapping platform. The test benches mimicked human eye motion to create a novel Human Inspired Camera System (HICS). I was a co-first author of the [paper submitted to the 2020 ISOCC Conference](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/other/HICSPaper.pdf).

### UCSD QI Calit2 Prototyping Lab (Summer 2019-Spring 2020)

## First Robotics Competition (FRC)

Design and build lead from 2017-2019 on FRC Team 3647. I led the team to grow from never having won an award to win three regional events, two finalist awards, and eight technical awards.

I led the development and design of all the below robots over a tight six week build season. All the robots that I have designed utilize ESCs with brushed and brushless motors, closed loop feedback control with encoders, and pneumatic actuators.


![FRC 2022](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FRC2022Collage.png?raw=true)

**2022 Robot:** I designed the drivetrain, serializer, and climber mechanisms.
<br/><br/>

![FRC 2020](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FRC2020Collage.png?raw=true)

**2020 Robot:** I designed the drivetrain, intake, and shooter mechanisms.
<br/><br/>

![FRC 2019](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FRC2019Collage.png?raw=true)

**2019 Robot:** I designed the entire robot including the drivetrain, elevator, intakes, and climber mechanisms. <br/><br/>

![FRC 2018](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FRC2018.jpeg?raw=true)

**2018 Robot:** I designed the drivetrain, climbing, and intaking mechanisms.
<br/><br/>

![FRC 2017](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FRC2017.jpg?raw=true)

**2017 Robot:** I designed the drivetrain and climbing mechanisms.


## Machining

Various machining projects from over the years on manual machines, HAAS CNC, HURCO CNC, and CNC Routers.

![FSAE](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FSAECollage.png?raw=true)

Above all were CAMed and cut on a HAAS VMC by myself for the UCSD FSAE team. 

![SWMIR Part 1](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SWIMRParts.jpg?raw=true)



Above parts were CAMed and cut on a HUCRO VM10i by myself for a 5 DOF Underwater robot
