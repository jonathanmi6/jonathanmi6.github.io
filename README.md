## Personal Projects

### Custom Mechanical Keyboard (South Paw FRL 1800)

![SPFRL1800 Blue/White & Black/White](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SP1.jpg?raw=true)

![PCB KiCAD](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SPPCB3.png?raw=true)

![PCB](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SPPCB2.jpg?raw=true)

Designed a unique layout mechanical keyboard and wrist rest from scratch using KiCAD, OnShape, and laser cutting. See [SPFRL1800 Open-Source Repository](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/SPFRL1800) for more details (and instructions on how to make your own!).

### Custom Mechanical Keyboard (Split Ortho)

![PCB](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/KBSplitOrtho.png?raw=true)

Designed a 3D printed split-ortholinear mechanical keyboard from scratch.

### Switch Opener

![Switch Opener](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SWOpener2.jpg?raw=true)

Designed and CNC machined mechanical keyboard switch opener using Solidworks, HSMWorks, and HURCO VM10i.

<!-- ## Research

### Terradynammics Lab at Johns Hopkins University

### Video Processing Lab at UCSD

### Qualcomm Calit2 Prototyping Lab -->

## First Robotics Competition (FRC)

Design and build lead from 2017-2019 on FRC Team 3647. I led the team to grow from never having won an award to win three regional events, two finalist awards, and eight technical awards.

I led the development and design of all the below robots over a tight six week build season.

2018 Robot: I designed the drivetrain, climbing, and intaking mechanisms.

![FRC 2017](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FRC2017.jpg?raw=true)

2017 Robot: I designed the drivetrain and climbing mechanisms.

## Machining

Various machining projects from over the years on manual machines, HAAS CNC, HURCO CNC, and CNC Routers.

![FSAE](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/FSAECollage.png?raw=true)

Above all were CAMed and cut on a HAAS VMC by myself for the UCSD FSAE team. 

![SWMIR Part 1](https://github.com/jonathanmi6/jonathanmi6.github.io/blob/main/images/SWIMRParts.jpg?raw=true)



Above parts were CAMed and cut on a HUCRO VM10i by myself for a 5 DOF Underwater robot
